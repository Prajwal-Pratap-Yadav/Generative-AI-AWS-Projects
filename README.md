## Repository Structure

### 1. **Notebooks**
- `Model_FineTuning.ipynb`:
  - Fine-tunes the foundation model for specific domain tasks.
  - Includes key outputs such as aspects of ubiquitous computing and model fine-tuning results.
- `Model_Evaluation_UdacityGenAIAWS.ipynb`:
  - Evaluates the performance of the fine-tuned model.
  - Contains outputs related to ubiquitous computing and evaluation metrics.

### 2. **Documentation**
- **`UDACITY_Introduction_to_Generative_AI_with_AWS_Screenshots.pdf`**:
  - Includes screenshots of fine-tuning and evaluation notebook outputs.
  - Contains AWS S3 bucket storage verification and model deployment lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **Model Fine-Tuning**:
  Learn how to adapt a large language model to domain-specific tasks using AWS.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  Understand the performance of fine-tuned models with key evaluation metrics.

- **Deployment and Management**:
  Includes steps for deploying the model on AWS and deleting endpoints after use to optimize costs.
