# Generative AI with AWS

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of generative AI using AWS services. It involves dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation. The goal is to build a lightweight generative AI model optimized for specific tasks.

## Features
- Model fine-tuning with custom datasets
- Evaluation metrics for generative models
- Utilization of AWS services for scalability and deployment

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other relevant ML frameworks
- AWS account and configured CLI for deployment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GenerativeAI_AWS_Project.git
    cd GenerativeAI_AWS_Project
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure AWS CLI:
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

## Usage
### Model Fine-Tuning
1. Open `Model_FineTuning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps for dataset preparation and model training.
3. Save the fine-tuned model for evaluation.

### Model Evaluation
1. Open `Model_Evaluation_UdacityGenAIAWS.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Load the fine-tuned model and evaluate its performance.
